learning textual analysis, such as STM, LDA, CTM and etc., as a technique support for research

## STM
Structural topic model, STM, is a novel topic model for textual analysis. The innovation beyond conventional models, such as LDA and CTM, is that it incorporates metadata as covariates, making estimating relationship between topics and metadata possible. R implements STM in package `stm`.
